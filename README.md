# Intro to TypeScript

## Getting ready

### 1. Check your software

You'll need to have this software installed for the course:

- Node.js >= v18.0.0 ([how to install](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/how-to-install-nodejs))

Check that you have the software versions that you need installed by running these
commands in your terminal:

```sh
# Check Node.js version.
node --version
```

We highly recommend that you use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
as your editor for this course as it provides lots of handy TypeScript related features,
but if you prefer to use a different editor that's fine too!

If you have GitHub Copilot or a similar AI coding assistant extension installed, we
recommend disabling that too so you can tackle the exercises and labs yourself.

### 2. Clone this repository with Git

You'll need to have this repository cloned so you can work on the coding
exercises during the course:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/MoonHighway/intro-to-typescript
```

> If you want to commit and push your work to your own repository on GitHub,
> you can [fork this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo),
> then clone your fork rather than this repository directly.
> If you do create a fork, you'll want to
> [sync it](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork)
> with this repository at the start of the workshop.

### 3. Install the dependencies

Run this command in your terminal to install the required dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

### 4. Open your editor and terminal

There are coding exercises throughout this workshop. To make sure you're ready:

- Open this project in your code editor.
- Open a terminal window for running commands, and `cd` to the directory for
  this project.

You're now ready to get started! ðŸš€

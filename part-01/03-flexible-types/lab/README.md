# Userland Lab

Create interface types that allow for detailed user profiles with dynamic object keys.

## Requirements

Create a:

1. **Create a `UserProfile` interface**: It should allow for the `username`, `email` and `premiumMember` properties in the `userProfile` object.

2. **Create a `DetailedUserProfile` interface**: It should allow for the same properties as `UserProfile`, but also allow for other properties containing miscellaneous user profile data, such as the `age` and `country` in the `userProfile` object.

3. Apply the `DetailedUserProfile` interface to the `userProfile` object.

4. Create an `updateProfile()` function which, given a user profile object, the name of a user profile property to update and a new value for the property, will
update the property in the user profile object with the new value.

5. Output the updated user profile object to confirm that it's been correctly updated.

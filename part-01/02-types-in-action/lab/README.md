# Lab: Music Trivia 🎶

> **Part 1: Section 2: Types in Action**

## Requirements

1. Implement the functionality for the `askTriviaQuestion()` function.
2. Add types for the function parameters. They should only allow the types of values which are currently being passed in the existing calls to the `formatMusicTrivia()` function.
3. Add a suitable return type to the function.
4. If the answer is a number, wrap it in `**` e.g. `**ANSWER**`.

### Extra credit

4. If the question contains the phrase "The Beatles", the `formatMusicTrivia()` function should throw an error. You can use whatever message you like for the error, but you must catch the error and output its `message` property.
